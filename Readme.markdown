# Simple ESP based sensor board
This is just my toy project to learn about designing PBC, electrical engineering and embedded software development.
Right now it's a ESP8266 based board with a temperature and humidity sensor.
In the long run I want to have a generic base design with an ESP32 that runs well on battery for a long time and where I can add any sensor or actor I want.
